NOTE: This codebase should probably not be used for any further websites. It was a means for me to tinker and learn, and I have since migrated my portfolio website to a different codebase.

# My Second Portfolio Website (2021-2022)
This repository contains the code for my 2021 through 2022 portfolio website. The website was built without any frameworks, allowing me to tinker with a vanilla full-stack codebase.
This tinkering led to numerous code refactors, most notably when I swapped the architecture from grouping files by file type to a Model-View-Controller architecture.
Since the codebase is vanilla and full of a learner's mistakes, adding new features began to become tedious. Furthermore, I didn't make updates frequently enought to justify the cost of the server with a database. 
Most importantly of all, the configuration file, which contains the website's sensitive information, is included in the GitHub repository (a big no-no), and so the repository had to remain private whilst my website was active.
Thus (as of 2023-04-21) I have since migrated the content of my portfolio website to a static site created with the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework.

I hosted this project using DigitalOcean, with NGINX as my web server, MySQL as my database, and Google Domains as my domain name registrar.
The website is built with vanilla PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.
